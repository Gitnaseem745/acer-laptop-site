# Acer Nitro Series V Model Product Website

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Acer Nitro Series V Model product website! This project showcases my skills in web development, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and responsive website.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** Achieved using pure CSS to ensure the site looks great on all devices.
- **Smooth Animations:** Implemented with GSAP for a visually appealing user experience.
- **3D Card Tilt Effect:** Added with Vanilla JavaScript for interactive product display.
- **Transparent Cards:** Designed to enhance the modern look and feel of the site.
- **Smart Footer Bar:** A footer that hides when you scroll down and reappears when you scroll up, providing easy navigation without clutter.

## Purpose
This project was created to test and showcase my skills as a beginner in web development technologies. I aimed to push the boundaries of what I could achieve with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while focusing on creating an engaging and user-friendly product page for Acer's Nitro Series V Model laptops.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, and contribute! Thank you for visiting my repository.
