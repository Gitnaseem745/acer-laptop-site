# Acer Nitro Series V Model Product Website

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Acer Nitro Series V Model product website! This project showcases my skills in web development, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and responsive website.

## Story Behind This Project

One day, I was roaming around on Flipkart searching for laptops when I came across an Acer laptop called Nitro V. After learning about its specs and other details, I came up with the idea to create a showcase website for this laptop. By doing so, I also wanted to test my coding skills so far. I decided to build this site from scratch.

First, I started designing the site in Figma. It took me a week to create, and finally, I turned my idea into a real design. Then, I moved to VS Code and started coding. Initially, I aimed to make the site simple, but then I realized that I had learned GSAP. So, I decided to incorporate it into this project to make the site more awesome.

That's the story of building this website. You can find the Figma design of this project here. [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/kocCHB1ZzFRLUSsPhYHGBe/Acer-Nitro-V-Product-Website-By-Naseem?node-id=0-1&t=wGAdICbPqF3kcRxw-1) 
## Features
- **Responsive Design:** Achieved using pure CSS to ensure the site looks great on all devices.
- **Smooth Animations:** Implemented with GSAP for a visually appealing user experience.
- **3D Card Tilt Effect:** Added with Vanilla JavaScript for interactive product display.
- **Transparent Cards:** Designed to enhance the modern look and feel of the site.
- **Smart Footer Bar:** A footer that hides when you scroll down and reappears when you scroll up, providing easy navigation without clutter.

## Purpose
This project was created to test and showcase my skills as a beginner in web development technologies. I aimed to push the boundaries of what I could achieve with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while focusing on creating an engaging and user-friendly product page for Acer's Nitro Series V Model laptops.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, and contribute! Thank you for visiting my repository.
